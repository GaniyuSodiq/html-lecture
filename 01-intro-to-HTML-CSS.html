HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at 
something on the internet. 

HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. 
All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. 

CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. 
HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, 
changes the font, and makes it look great!

Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as programming languages, 
but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, 
because they are only concerned with presenting information.

Yet, there is quite a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS.

JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML elements on your website after the site has been loaded, 
which gives you the ability to make your site more interactive and engaging for users.


HTML 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. 

We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, 
and links that make up a typical webpage.
