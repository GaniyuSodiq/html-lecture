<!-- 
HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at 
something on the internet. 

HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. 
All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. 

CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. 
HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, 
changes the font, and makes it look great!

Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as programming languages, 
but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, 
because they are only concerned with presenting information.

Yet, there is quite a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS.

JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML elements on your website after the site has been loaded, 
which gives you the ability to make your site more interactive and engaging for users.


HTML 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. 

We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, 
and links that make up a typical webpage.

 ⭐⭐⭐-- INRO TO HTML -- WORD DOC
Befor we get into writing some of our own code,
I want to talk a little bit about what html is and 
how we can write it.


I am not starting in code editor.

I am starting in a Google DOC bcs i want to talk 
about the purose of HTML before we actually start 
writing it.

Because it is really important to understand why we
are writing what we are writing.

Right now i have some text in Google Doc/MS Doc etc
If i select the text, i can make the font bigger

I can also select the Normal Text and pick 
a Ttile, Subtitle, Heading 1, Heading 2 etc

Lets say I pick Heading 1. This is going to change
how the text looks.
Lets say we have some random paragraphs aswell

These paragraphs will be under the heading.
Effectively creating what looks like an outline
for us.

Say we have more headings like 
What is HTML  

What is CSS

This outline can be called document structure.

This is similar to menus or links that you see on a
webpage. You can click around and crontol what you see

we are doing the same thing when we write HTML.
But we cannot do it with options that you see in 
MS word here.

We are writing code that is telling the browser instead
of our word doc here, telling the browser what everything
we are doing is. 
And we have to be very explicit in what we are doing.
ie very detailed in our description.

Lets take an example.

⭐⭐⭐ in my code editor here - VSCode. I can write 
-->
HTML & CSS for absolute beginners

<!-- lets say i want that to be title of my page. -->

These two languages are super awesome

All about HTML

HTML is...

All about CSS

CSS is...

<!-- 
we can take a look at this document i just created 
in the browser, and see what weve got. 
-->

<!-- 
All the text appears on a single line. 
this is not what i wanted.

Basically i have wrote a bunch of things 
but i have not told the browser what they are.

I even have line breaks in the code editor here 
but non of that is showing in the browser.

As far as the brower is concern... 
it doesnt know that these things are. 
It will just throw them out to the page
